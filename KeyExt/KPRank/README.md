# KPRank

This directory hosts modified code for the `KPRank` approach, which can be found from its official [repo](https://github.com/PatelKrutarth/KPRank).

## Setup
Follow the instructions from the original repo.  
Afterwards replace the files with the modified ones.  
The `dataset_dir` variable in `main.py` needs to be set to the dataset directory path.  
The `dsdir` and `model_version` variables in `run_scibert_model` need to be set.
