# RVA

This directory contains the modified code for the [RVA](https://github.com/epapagia/RVA) approach.

## Setup
Follow the instructions from the original repo.  
Afterwards replace the files with the modified ones.  
In `main.py`, `base_path` and the path in `subprocess.call` need to be set for the dataset directory and the `.sh` script respectively.
