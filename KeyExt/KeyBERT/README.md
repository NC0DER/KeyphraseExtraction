# KeyBERT

This directory hosts code to run and benchmark the [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) approach.

## Setup
In order to run this approach, you need to `pip install keybert` and modify the `base_path` in `KeyBERT.py`, which is used to access the dataset directory.  
If you wish to run the `benchmark()` function you need to set the `output_path`, as well.
